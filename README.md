# ytbot
GIMME those views!!!


## THIS BOT GENERATES GENUINE YOUTUBE VIEWS ##

How to install?

pip install ytbot

what are the requirements?

python3.6 or above \n
chromium-browser(developer version) 
A few google accounts(this is important) 
*a little bit of patience




How to use it?

Once installed ytbot, go to the terminal and write "ytbot configure" then follow the instructions there. 
You will need to provide the path to a chromium-browser that you installed(developer version of course) after that, add a few google accounts(remember to give right infos) it's necessary because of the way this bot works. 
The mechanics is like that you get 1 view per account every 10 minutes. So, 10 account means 10 views per 10 minutes. 20 account means 20 views per 10 minutes! and so on. Cool right? But beware! It will eat alot of ram.
after entering google infos,then it will ask for youtube video url. provide as many as you want.But keep the number less than 10 for better performance.

When the configuration is complete, run the bot symply by "ytbot run" or "ytbot run -h" for headless/silent mode.(headless means no window)
